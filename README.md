# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-MODEL
#This model, built upon OpenAI's advanced embedding system, has been trained and validated using the expansive "Twitter Sentiment Dataset" available on Kaggle. Its primary function is to proficiently identify and classify sentiments, detect hate speech, and pinpoint biased opinions. The overarching goal of this initiative is to substantially reduce instances of hate crimes and profanity across social media platforms. Moreover, it serves as a robust solution for detecting negative sentiments in any large-scale language or speech system. Its application aims to foster a more positive and respectful digital communication environment for all users.
